            <p>
              In 1970, Luca Mele began his career in the elevator industry. His
              superior craftsmanship was quickly noticed by management and Luca
              soon became Shop Foreman for a prominent elevator company. From a
              very early age, Luca’s son Dino developed an interest in fine
              cabinetry skills through working alongside his father. Dino
              started working in the elevator industry in the late seventies,
              specializing in many departments, including structural steel and
              elevator fixtures.
              <br />
              <br />
              In 1992, Luca and Dino Mele founded Premier Elevator, merging old
              world craftsmanship with efficient, modern technology. They began
              in a small 3,000 square foot shop and worked extremely well
              together as a father and son team, creatively coming up with
              solutions and then using highly developed skills to implement
              their designs. With increased client demand and the addition of
              efficient CNC (Computerized Numerical Control) manufacturing
              equipment, their production facility quickly grew into our current
              65,000 square foot facility. Dino and Luca continue to work
              together at Premier Elevator, collaborating with our skilled teams
              to create custom solutions for buildings of all sizes.
